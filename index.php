        <p class="particle">... and particle wizard</p>
        <p class="about-text">My name is josh Whitkin. I’m a professional with more than 7 years of industry experience
            in
            Games Design, Level design, Scripting and Visual Effects. What makes me passionate about games
            is the combination of technology and creativity, and how multiple disciplines come together to
            create an interactive experience. Whether I'm designing for puzzle games, 2D platformers or 3D
            environments.
            I always tell a story.</p>
